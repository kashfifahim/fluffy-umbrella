JavaScript provides a .replace() method that enables you to replace characters in a string with another string. This method accepts two arguments. The first argument is the character sequence to be replaced, which can be either a string or a regex pattern. The second argument is the string that replaces the matched sequence.

Since strings are immutable, the replace method returns a new string with the replaced characters.

In this example, the replace method is used to replace all instances of the letter l with the number 1 in the string hello.

"hello".replace(/l/g, "1");
Use your regex to replace all instances of +, -, and a space in str with an empty string. Return this value.

Regex has a flag for this, however â€“ the i flag, which stands for "insensitive".

/Hello/i
The following regex would match hello, Hello, HELLO, and even hElLo because of the i flag. This flag makes your pattern case-insensitive.

The + modifier in a regex allows you to match a pattern that occurs one or more times. To match your digit pattern one or more times, add a plus after each of the digit character classes. For example: [0-9]+.

There is a shorthand character class to match any digit: \d. Replace your [0-9] character classes with this shorthand.
